# Chat_Room
Developed a simple chat application that enables real-time messaging between multiple clients and a central server.
The application utilizes socket programming in Python, leveraging TCP/IP protocols for communication. The server-client architecture allows for concurrent connections, facilitating seamless interaction among users. 


Key features include:

Server-Client Communication: Implemented a server-side component responsible for handling client connections, message broadcasting, and user management.

Multi-User Support: Enabled multiple clients to connect simultaneously, allowing for group conversations and private messaging between users.

User Interface: Designed a basic text-based interface for both the server and client sides, ensuring ease of use and straightforward interaction.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions, ensuring the stability and reliability of the application.
